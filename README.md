# Artificial Intelligence Internship Projects

This repository contains projects completed during my internship at Cognorise Info related to Artificial Intelligence.

## 1. Digit Recognizer using Deep Learning

### Description:
Implemented a digit recognizer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the MNIST dataset. The model is trained to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) with high accuracy.

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- MNIST dataset

### Files:
- `digit_recognizer.py`: Python script containing the code for the digit recognizer model.
- `README.md`: Markdown file providing information about the project.

## 2. Tic Tac Toe Game with AI Opponent

### Description:
Developed a Tic Tac Toe game with a simple AI opponent using Python and Tkinter GUI library. The game allows the player to play against the AI and implements the minimax algorithm for AI move prediction.

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- Tkinter

### Files:
- `tic_tac_toe.py`: Python script containing the code for the Tic Tac Toe game with AI opponent.
- `README.md`: Markdown file providing information about the project.

## 3. Ping Pong Game with AI Opponent

### Description:
Created a Ping Pong game with an AI-controlled opponent using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game includes features such as score tracking, game pausing, and player name editing.

### Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Files:
- `pingpong.html`: HTML file containing the code for the Ping Pong game.
- `README.md`: Markdown file providing information about the project.
